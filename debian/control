Description: Elegant, powerful, clean dock
 A full fledged dock application that makes opening common applications and
 managing windows easier and quicker. Docky is fully integrated into the GNOME
 Desktop and features a no non-sense approach to configuration and usage.
 It just works.
 .
 Docky provides an application launcher, running application management, and
 various "docklets" including a CPU monitor, weather report and clock.  It is
 similar to other docks such as AWN and cairo-dock.
 .
 Applications can integrate with Docky to add extra items to their context
 menus or modify their icons to display more information.  This package
 includes integration helpers for a number of applications, including Banshee,
 Rhythmbox, Deluge, Tomboy and Zeitgeist.
 .
 Docky is derived from the GNOME Do "docky" interface.
